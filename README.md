# Shidacea-Inuhh-Emulation
Emulation script to play Inuhh Shinvasion using the Shidacea Engine

Current version: 0.3.0

## Description

This project serves as an emulation layer to port the game Inuhh Shinvasion to the Shidacea-Engine.
Since Inuhh Shinvasion 1 was written using the Gosu library, this project does redirect all Gosu bindings to Shidacea routines without touching the original code.

This can also be used as a template to port other projects written in another Ruby game engine to Shidacea.

## Instructions

Just install a working build of the Shidacea engine with Launshi and clone this project (including the Inuhh Shinvasion submodule) into the projects folder.
Then, start Launshi and start the project Inuhh Shinvasion.

Currently, the best option is to use Shipectral as the base engine.
